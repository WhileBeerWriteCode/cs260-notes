# Assignment
JK, he's not going to check the array copy assignment.

Instead: Copy only the even numbers into the destination array.
Inspect the least significant bit to see if number is even.

Example:
src: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
dest: [2, 4, 6, 8]


# Actual Notes

`jal` stands for jump and link. It jumps and places the return address into a register.
This only applies for a single level of subroutine call.  More than one subroutine
call must place the return address on the stack.
